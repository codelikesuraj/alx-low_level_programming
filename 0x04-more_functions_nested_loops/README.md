|File|Description|
|-|-|
|[0-isupper.c](0-isupper.c)|A function that checks for uppercase character. Prototype is 'int \_isupper(int c)'. Returns '1' if 'c' is uppercase and '0' otherwise.|
|[1-isdigit.c](1-isdigit.c)|A function that checks for a digit (0-9). Prototype is 'int \_isdigit(int c)'. Returns '1' if 'c' is a digit and '0' otherwise.|
|[2-mul.c](2-mul.c)|A function that multiplies two integers. Prototype is 'int mul(int a, int b)'.| 
|[3-print_numbers.c](3-print_numbers.c)|A function that prints the numbers from '0' to '9', followed by a new line. Prototype is 'void print_numbers(void)'. '\_putchar' is only used twice.|
|[4-print_most_numbers.c](4-print_most_numbers.c)|A function that prints the numbers from '0' to '9' (except '2' and '4'), followed by a new line. Prototype is 'void print_most_numbers(void)'. '\_putchar' is only used twice.|
|[5-more_numbers](5-more_numbers)|A function that prints 10 times, the numbers, from '0' to '14', followed by a new line. Prototype is 'void more_numbers(void)'. '\_putchar' can only be used 3 times.|
|[6-print_line.c](6-print_line.c)|A function that drwas a straight line in the terminal. Prototype is 'void print_line(int n)'. Only '\_putchar' can be used to print. 'n' is the number of times the character '\_' should be printed. The lines should end with a newline. If 'n' is 0 orless, the function should only print a new line.|
|[7-print_diagonal.c](7-print_diagonal.c)|A function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal. Prototype is 'void print_diagonal(int n)'. Only '\_putchar' can be used to print. 'n' is the nuber of times the character '\' should be printed. The diagonal should end with a new line. If 'n' is 0 or less, the function should only print a new line.|
