|-|-|
|[0-main.c](0-main.c) [main.h](main.h)|Create a file named '0-main.c' that test that the function 'positive_or_negative()' gives the correct output when given a case of '0'.|
|[1-main.c](1-main.c)|Copy the file and comment out (not delete) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.|
|2-largst_number.c](2-largest_number.c) [main.h](main.h)|Fix the code in '2-largest_number.c' so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case. P.S line count will not be checked for this task :).|
|[3-print_remaining_days.c](3-print_remaining_days.c) [main.h](main.h)|Fix the 'print_remaining_days()' function so that the output works correctly for _all_ dates and _all_ leap years. Assume that the value of 'month' is between 1 & 12 and 'day' is between 1 and 31.|
