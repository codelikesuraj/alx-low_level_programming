|[0-main.c](0-main.c) [main.h](main.h)|Create a file named '0-main.c' that test that the function 'positive_or_negative()' gives the correct output when given a case of '0'.|
|[1-main.c](1-main.c)|Copy the file and comment out (not delete) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.|
|2-largst_number.c](2-largest_number.c) [main.h](main.h)|Fix the code in '2-largest_number.c' so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case. P.S line count will not be checked for this task :).|
