|File|Description|
|-|-|
|[0-print_name.c](0-print_name.c)|A function that prints a name. Prototype is 'void print_name(char \*name, void (\*f)(char \*))'.|
|[1-array_iterator.c](1-array_iterator.c)|A function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array. Prototype is 'void array_iterator(int \*array, size_t size, void (\*action)(int))', where 'size' is the size of the array and 'action' is a pointer to the function you need to use.|
|[2-int_index.c](2-int_index.c)|A functino that searches for an integer. Prototype is 'int int_index(int \*array, int size, int (\*cmp)(int)), where 'size' is the number of elements in the array 'array', 'cmp', is a pointer to the function to be used to compare values, 'int_index' returns the index of the first element for which the 'cmp' function does not return '0'. If no element matches or size <= 0, return '-1'.|
|[3-main.c](3-main.c), [3-op_functions.c](3-op_functions.c), [3-get_op_func.c](3-get_op_func.c), [3-calc.h](3-calc.h)|A program that performs simple operations. Using the standard library is allowed. Usage is 'calc num1 operator num2'. You can assume 'num1' & 'num2' are integers, so the 'atoi' function should be used to convert them from the string input to 'int'. 'operator' can be any of the following - '+': addition, '-':subtraction, '\*':multiplication, '/':division or '%':modulo. The program prints the result of the operation followed by a new line. Assume that the result of the operations can be stored in an 'int'. If the number of arguments is wrong, print 'Error', followed by a new line, and exit with the status of '98'. If the 'operator' is none of the above, print 'Error', followed by a new line, and xit with the status '99'. If the user tries to divide (/ or %) by 0, print 'Error', followed by a new line, and exit with the status '100'. NOTE: the task requires that the four files are created.|
|[3-calc.h](3-calc.h)|This file contains all the function prototypes and data structures used by the program.|
|3-op_functions.c](3-op_functions.c)|This file should contain the 5 following functions (not more) - 1. op_add: returns the sum of 'a' and 'b'. Prototype is 'int op_add(int a, int b);'. 2. op_sub: returns the difference of 'a' and 'b'. Prototype is 'int op_sub(int a, int b);'. 3. op_mul: returns the product of 'a' and 'b'. Prototype is 'int op_mul(int a, int b);'. 4. op_div: returns the result of the division of 'a' by 'b'. Prototype is 'int op_div(int a, int b);'. 5. op_mod: returns the remainder of the division of 'a' by 'b'. Prototype is 'int op_mod(int a, int b);'.|
|[3-get_op_func.c](3-get_op_func.c)|This file should contain the function that selcts the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user. You're not allowed to declare any other functions. Prototype is 'int (\*get_op_func(char \*s))(int, int);', where 's' is the operator passed as argument to the program. This function returns a pointer to the function that corresponds to the operator given as a parameter. Example: 'get_op_func("+") should return a pointer to the function 'op_add'. NOTE: you are not allowed to use 'switch' statements, 'for' or 'do ... while' loops, 'goto', 'else', more than one 'if' statement in your code, and more than one 'while' loop in your code. If 's' does not match any of the 5 expected operators (+, -, \*, /, %), return 'NULL'. Only these two variables are allowed to be declared in this function.|
[3-main.c](3-main.c)|This file should contain the 'main' function only. You are not allowed to code any other function than 'main' in this file. You are not allowed to directly call 'op_add', 'op_sub', 'op_mul', 'op_div' or 'op_mod' from the 'main' function. You have to use 'atoi' to convert arguments to 'int'. You are not allowed to use any kind of loop. You are allowed to use a maximum of 3 'if' statements.|
