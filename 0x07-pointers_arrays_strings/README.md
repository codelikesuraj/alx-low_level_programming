|-|-|
|[0-memset.c](0-memset.c)|A function that fills a memory with a constant byte. Prototype is 'char \*\_memset(char \*s, char b, unsigned int n). The '\_memset()' function fills the first 'n' bytes of the memory area pointed to by 's' with the constant byte 'b'. Returns a pointer to the memory area 's'. Hint: memset.|
|[1-memcpy.c](1-memcpy.c)|A function that copies memory area. Prototype is 'char \*\_memcpy(char \*dest, char \*src, unsigned int n)'. The '\_memcpy()' function copies 'n' bytes from memory area 'src' to memory area 'dest'. Returns a pointer to 'dest'.|
|[2-strchr.c](2-strchr.c)|A function that locates a character in a string. Prototype is 'char \*\_strchr(char \*s, char c)'. Returns a pointer to the first occurence of the character 'c' in the string 's', or 'NULL' if the charcter is not found.|
|[3-strspn.c](3-strspn.c)|A function that gets the length of a prefix substring. Prototype is 'unsigned int \_strspn(char \*s, char \*accept)'. Returns the number of bytes in the inital segment of 's' which consist only of bytes from 'accept'.|
|[4-strpbrk.c](4-strpbrk.c)|A function that searches a string for any set of bytes. Prototype is 'char \*\_strpbrk(char \*s, char \*accept)'. The '\_strpbrk()' function locates the first occurence in the string 's' of any of the bytes in the string 'accept'. Returns a pointer to the byte in 's' that matches one of the bytes in 'accept', or 'NULL' if no such byte is found.|
|[5-strstr.c](5-strstr.c)|A function that locates a substring. Prototype is 'char \*\_strstr(char \*haystack, char \*needle)'. The '\_strstr()' function finds that the first occurence of the substring 'needle' in the string 'haystack'. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared. Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or 'NULL' if the substring is not found.|
