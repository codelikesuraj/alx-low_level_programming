|[0-positive_or_negative.c](0-positive_or_negative.c)|A program that assigns a random to variable 'n' each time it is executed and prints if it is 'positive', 'negative', or 'zero.'|
|[1-last_digit.c](1-last_digit.c)|A program that assigns a random number to 'n' each time it is executed. Takes the last value of the digit and check if it is 'greater than 5', 'zero' or 'less than 6 but not zero'.|
|[2-print_alphabet.c](2-print_alphabet.c)|A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase followed by a new line using only 'putchar' which is allowed only twice in the code.|
|[3-print_alphabets.c](3-print_alphabets.c)|A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase followed by a new line using only 'putchar' which is allowed only thrice in the code.|
|[4-print_alphabt](4-print_alphabt)|A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase except for 'q' and 'e' followed by a new line using only 'putchar' which is allowed only twice in the code.|
|[5-print_numbers.c](5-print_numbers.c)|A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from '0', followed by a new line.|
|[6-print_numberz.c](6-print_numberz.c)|A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from '0', followed by a new line. Variable type 'char' is not allowed and only 'putchar' (used twice only) can be used.|
