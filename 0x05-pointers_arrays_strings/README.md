|-|-|
|[0-reset_to_98](0-reset_to_98)|A function that takes a pointer to an 'int' as parameter and updated the value it point to to '98'. Prototype is 'void reset_to_98(int \*n)'.|
|[1-swap.c](1-swap.c)|A function that swaps the values of two integers. Prototype is 'void swap_int(int \*a, int \*b)'.|
|[2-strlen.c](2-strlen.c)|A function that returns the length of a string. Prototype is 'int \_strlen(char \*s)'.|
|[3-puts.c](3-puts.c)|A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to 'stdout'. Prototype is 'void \_puts(char \*str)'.|
|[4-print_rev.c](4-print_rev.c)|A function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line. Prototype is 'void print_rev(char \*s)'.|
|[5-rev_string.c](5-rev_string.c)|A function that reverses a string. Prototype is 'void rev_string(char \*s)'.|
|[6-puts2.c](6-puts2.c)|A function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line. Prototype is 'void puts2(char \*str)'.|
|[7-puts_half.c](7-puts_half.c)|A function that prints the second half of a string, followed by a new line. Prototype is 'void puts_half(char \*str)'. If the number of characters is odd, use this formula '(length_of_the_string - 1) / 2' to get the number of second half.|
|[8-print_array.c](8-print_array.c)|A function that prints 'n' elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line. Prototype is 'void print_array(int \*a, int n)', where 'n' is the number of elements of the array to be printed. Numbers are separated by comma, followed by a space and should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array. P.S. 'printf' is allowed :).|
|[9-strcpy.c](9-strcpy.c)|A function that copies the string pointed to by 'src', including the terminating null byte '\0', to the buffer pointed to by 'dest'. Prototype is 'char \*\_strcpy(char \*dest, char \*src)'. Return value is the pointer to 'dest'.|
