|File|Description|
|-|-|
|[0-putchar.c](0-putchar.c)|Write a program that prints '\_putchar' followed by a newline.|
|[1-alphabet.c](1-alphabet.c)|A function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. Prototype is 'void print_alphabet(void)' and '\_putchar' can only be used twice.|
|[2-print_alphabet_x10.c](2-print_alphabet_x10.c)|A function that prints all the alphabets in lowercase followed by a new line 10 times. Prototype is 'void print_alphabet_x10(void)' and '\_putchar' can only be used twice.|
|[3-islower.c](3-islower.c)|A function that checks for lowercase character. Prototype is 'int \_islower(int c)' and returns '1' if 'c' is lowercase and '0' otherwise.|
|[4-isalpha.c](4-isalpha.c)|A function that checks for alphabetic characters. Prototype is 'int \_isalpha(int c)' and returns '1' if 'c' is a letter, lowercase or uppercase and '0' otherwise.|
|[5-sign.c](5-sign.c)|A function that prints the sign of a number. Prototype is 'int print_sign(int n)' and returns '1' and print '+' if 'n' is greater than zero, returns '0' and prints '0' if 'n' is zero and returns '-1' and prints '-' if 'n' is less than zero.|
|[6-abs.c](6-abs.c)|A function that computes the absolute value of an integer. Prototype is 'int \_abs(int)'.|
|[7-print_last_digit.c](7-print_last_digit.c)|A function that prints the last digit of a number. Prototype is 'int print_last_digit(int)' and return the value of the last digit.|
|[8-24_hours.c](24-hourse.c)|A function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59. Prototype is 'void jack_bauer(void)'.|
|[9-times_table.c](9-times_table.c)|A function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0. Prototype is 'void times_table(void)'.|
|[10-add.c](10-add.c)|A function that adds two integers and returns the result. Prototype is 'iint add (int, int)'.|
|[11-print_to_98.c](11-print_to_98.c)|A function that prints all natural numbers from 'n' to '98', followed by a new line. Prototype is 'void print_to_98(int n). Numbers are separated by a comma, followed by a space. The first number should be 'n' all the way to '98'. Using the standard library is permitted.|
