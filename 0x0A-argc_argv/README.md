||[0-whatsmyname.c](0-whatsmyname.c)|A program that prints its name, followed by a new line. If the program is renamed, it will still print the new name, without having to compile it again. The path should not be removed before the name of the program.|
|[1-args.c](1-args.c)|A program that prints the number of arguments passed into it. It should print a number, followed by a new line.|
|[2-args.c](2-args.c)|A program that prints all arguments it receives. All arguments are printed including the first one and each argument should be printed on a single line, ending it all with a new line.|
|[3-mul.c](3-mul.c)|A progam that multiplies two numbers. It should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line. If the program does not receive two arguments, the program should print 'Error', followed by a new line, and return '1'. Assume the two number and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer.|
|[4-add.c](4-add.c)|A program that adds positive numbers. Their sum should be printed followed by a new line. If no number is passed to the program, print '0', followed by a new line. If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print 'Error', followed by a new line, and return '1'. Assume that the numbers and their sum can be stored in an 'int'.|

|[100-change.c](100-change.c)|A program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money. Usage './change cents'. 'cents' is the amount of cents you need to give back. If the number of arguments passed to the program is not exactly '1', print 'Error', followed by a new line, and return '1'. 'atoi' function should be used to parse the parameter passed to the program. If the number passed as argument is negative, print '0', followed by a new line. Unlimited number of coins of values 25, 10, 5, 2 and 1 cent can be used.|
