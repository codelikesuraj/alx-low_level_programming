||[0-create_array.c](0-create_array.c)|A function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char. Prototype is 'char create_array(unsigned int size, char c)'. Returns 'NULL' if size = 0. Returns a pointer to the array, or 'NULL" if it fails.|
|[1-strdup.c](1-strdup.c)|A function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a paremeter. Prototype is 'char \*\_strdup(char \*str)'. The '\_strdup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string 'str'. Memory for the new string is obtained with 'malloc', and can be freed with 'free'. Returns 'NULL" if str = 'NULL'. On success, the '\_strdup' function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. It returns 'NULL' if insufficient memory was available.|
|[2-str_concat.c](2-strconcat.c)|A function that concatenates two strings. Prototype is 'char \*str_concat(char \*s1, char \*s2)'. The returned pointer should point to a newly allocated space in memory which conatins the contents of 's1', followed by the contents of 's2', and null terminated. If NULL is passed, treat it as an empty string. The function should return NULL on failure.|
|[3-alloc_grid.c](3-alloc_grid.c)|A functin that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers. Prototype is 'int \*\*alloc_grid(int width, int height)'. Each element of the grid should be initialized to 0. The function should return NULL on failure. If width and height is 0 or negative, return NULL.|
|[4-free_grid.c](4-free_grid.c)|A function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by [3-alloc_grid.c](alloc_grid) function. Prototype is 'void free_grid(int \*\*grid, int height)'.|

|[100-argstostr.c](100-argstostr.c)|A function that concatenates all the arguments in a program. Prototype is 'char \*argstostr(int ac, char \*\*av)'.Returns NULL if 'ac == 0', 'av == NULL' or if it fails or returns a pointer to a new string. Each argument should be followed by a '\n' in the new string.|
